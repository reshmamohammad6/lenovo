            <p>I understand you are not comfortable performing the TSS. However, there are few basic TSS that I would request you to perform and I could guide you with the TSS over the phone or I could take the system on the remote access or I could take the system on a video call and help you with the TSS. This TSS might resolve your issue if the issue is not resolved. I will assist you further.</p>

                I understand you would like an engineer to visit your location, however there are few basic TSS that I would request you to perform and I could guide you with the TSS.
                    These TSS might resolve your issue and if the issue is not resolved, it will be at least help me to isolate the faulty part & I will be able to alighn the engineer for
